# Holocron Lamp for the Discerning Jedi

This project is based off of the [Holocron Lamp for the Discerning Jedi by Dave Clarke](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1762432)

List of changes made:
-----
I decided to make a few of these lamps as christmas gifts for my younger siblings as such the Particle IoT funtionality isn't necessary so that functionality has been stripped out. The code has been adjusted to run on the [Adafruit Metro Mini](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2590) using Pins A0, D9, D10 and D11

Additionally (because this will be around children) I have modified the code to store the on/off status in the EEPOM and read it during start-up. I felt this made it a bit safer.
